Introduction
The Intelligent Traffic Management System is a computer vision-based application designed to monitor and manage traffic in real-time. The system utilizes computer vision algorithms and deep learning models to process live or recorded traffic videos, detect vehicles, analyze traffic flow, and generate intelligent traffic insights. This project aims to improve overall traffic management, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety by providing valuable data to traffic authorities and planners.

Features
Real-time vehicle detection: The system can detect vehicles in a live traffic feed and track their movements.
Traffic flow analysis: Analyze the traffic flow and congestion patterns at different times of the day.
Vehicle counting: Count the number of vehicles passing through specific road segments.
Speed detection: Measure the speed of vehicles to identify potential speed violators.
Incident detection: Detect and alert on unusual events such as accidents or road blockages.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
YOLO Algorithm
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip or conda:
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
or
conda install opencv  numpy pandas matplotlib
Download the pre-trained model weights (if required) and place them in the appropriate directories.
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the traffic management system application:
python traffic_management_system.py
The application will start processing the video feed and display the results, including vehicle detection, traffic flow analysis, and other insights.
